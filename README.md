# CSS Triforce

It's dangerous to go alone.

**CSS Triforce** makes use of CSS borders and pseudo-elements to create a mighty triforce that adapts to the `font-size` of its parent.

## Usage

Import the CSS:

``` CSS
@import "css-triforce.css";
```

Use the `.css-triforce` class in an empty element, like `span`:

``` HTML
<span class="css-triforce"></span>
```

## Browser Support

Firefox renders the triangles terribly. Chrome can distort it a bit in some font sizes. Safari renders the triforce perfectly.
